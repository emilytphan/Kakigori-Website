            <p>This is an interest calculator that'll help you calculate how long it will take to
            reach your desired financial goal. By entering your current amount of money,
            your future amount, and an unlimited amount of interest rates,
            you can see how long it will take to achieve your goal. The calculator uses these
            inputs to compute the number of years required based on the specified interest rates.
            All you do is input the amount you currently have, the amount you want in the future,
            and the interest rates of your choice. Try it now! </p>
